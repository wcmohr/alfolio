I have a background in accounting from which I have learned skills in organization, communication, and attention to detail.  I discovered a love for data manipulation while working with spreadsheets, and made the time into analytics and data science.  Time spent preparing for actuarial exams lent the conceptual understanding of statistical methods and prepared me to tackle data science projects with the nuance and rigor required for arriving at robust conclusions.
